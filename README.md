A simple template for making <i>tactical role-playing games</i> on [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/).
This is not a fully functional game framework or a professional work, just a simple project made in my free time. 
Anyways, feel free to use this sample in your own game. 

- You can see all project's features on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/lJKWlLwYDZY).
